**Personal Data Notice and Consent**

As part of the application process you are giving personal data to the Foundation. Personal data protection laws require that the Foundation records your consent for the use of the data and gives you notice of how your data will be used. After completing the process you will get an email notice with this information.

Personal data means any data that can be connected to you as an individual. The kinds of data that you give to the Foundation includes:

-   data that you give to the Foundation during the application process including this form, and
-   if your application is successful then data necessary for the operation of the Fellowship. 

The Foundation is committed to diversity and does not seek personal data in special categories such as party political opinions. But some of the personal data held by the Foundation may fall into the category of special data, for example a commitment to open knowledge may be regarded as political or philosophical. When this happens the Foundation retains and uses that data in the course of its activities as a non-profit organisation to achieve our aim of an open knowledge society with limitless possibilities for all. When the Foundation does have special data it is subject to appropriate safeguards and is not shared outside the Foundation without your consent unless you have already made it public. 

The Foundation will keep this data for as long as it is needed to comply with financial and tax laws; to report to the Trustees of the Foundation on the activities of the Foundation, to comply with the Foundation’s commitment to openness and transparency, and to accomplish the Foundation's mission of creating an open knowledge society with limitless possibilities for all. 

**You have rights over your data.**

-   You can ask us to tell you what personal data we have about you, to update, correct or delete personal data that we have about you.
-   When you ask us to do any of these things we will usually be able to do them. But sometimes laws, such as finance laws will prevent us from doing what you ask. If that happens we will tell you. Whatever has been done with the data before you make a request is not affected by the request and remains valid.
-   You can also request that your data can be restricted, which means it is stored but not used, because you contest the accuracy of the data or the basis on which the Foundation is using it.
-   You can also ask us to port your data, either giving you a copy in a standard format or request the Foundation to send your data in a standard format to someone else. If you request the Foundation to port your data to someone else then the Foundation cannot ensure that the someone you choose will look after your data. You must deal with that person directly to ensure they look after your data appropriately.

The Foundation often has to communicate personal data to service providers for example email hosting services. The services are all subject to the same laws on personal data as the Foundation.

The Foundation is an international organisation which originated in South Africa. The Foundation works with brilliant people all around the world to bring about positive change. The Foundation shares your personal data with members of staff, consultants and service providers some of whom are not in the European Union. The European Union has not yet assessed the laws on personal data in many of the countries where the Foundation sends data. As a result your personal data may not receive the same protection from the law in those countries as it would in the European Union. But all of the companies and people who are part of the Foundation are bound to safeguard your data.

If you want to learn more about these safeguards, or to access, update, correct, delete, port restrict or object to use of your data send an email to [privacy@shuttleworthfoundation.org](https://privacy@shuttleworthfoundation.org/)

If you think that the Foundation has not dealt with your personal data appropriately you can also make a complaint to a data authority about how the Foundation uses data. Legally SF Isle of Man Limited is the controller of your data, so you can complain to the Isle of Man Information Commissioner.

If you live in the European Union you will be able to complain to an authority where you live or you can complain to the the Isle of Man Information Commissioner.

- [ ] I agree that you can use my personal data, including the data on my political opinions and philosophical beliefs as described in this consent and notice.
